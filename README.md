# ðŸ“¦ DeliverIQ â€” Microservice Logistics System

## Overview

DeliverIQ is a backend-focused microservice logistics system developed as part of a course project. The system is built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, and follows the **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles.

The application provides services for:
- Managing delivery routes
- Handling user orders and payments
- Integrating with external APIs like OSRM for routing and Stripe/CryptoCloud for payments

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3**
- **Kafka** â€” asynchronous communication between services
- **PostgreSQL** â€” persistent storage
- **Docker & Docker Compose** â€” containerization and local orchestration
- **OpenStreetMap / OSRM** â€” route calculation API
- **Stripe & CryptoCloud** â€” fiat and crypto payments
- **React (optional)** â€” frontend for user interaction
- **Leaflet.js** â€” map rendering (if frontend is used)

## ðŸ§© Microservices

- **API Gateway** â€” entry point to the system (Spring Cloud Gateway)
- **Routing Service** â€” calculates optimal delivery paths
- **Order Service** â€” handles customer orders and capacity checks
- **Payment Service** â€” processes fiat and crypto payments
- **Notification Service** â€” sends alerts and confirmations
- **User Service** â€” manages user registration and authentication

Each service communicates via Kafka events and exposes RESTful APIs.
